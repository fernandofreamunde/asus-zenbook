### Welcome

This Repo has some Scripts created with the purpous of making my life easier while using my work laptop.

These scripts were created for the Asus Zenbook UX461U with ElementaryOS Loki.

Some anoyances were detected by me and I wanted to fix them.

For example the `fn` + `F9` combination does not deactivate the touchpad. This could be because of the kernel or because Asus just does not care about decent OS. Anyway I just figured a way to making it work using xinput. you can see the script. Adapt however you need it, fell Free.
